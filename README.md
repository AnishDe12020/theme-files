Theme files for genicsblog.com

**This is not a proper Jekyll theme**. This repo contains only the theme files that genicsblog.com's repo retrevies at GitHub action's runtime to build the site.

WIP: We are working on a script that would help you setup the local environment for testing Genics Blog locally.
